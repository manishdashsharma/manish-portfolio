# Infrastructure: The Hidden Performance Bottleneck

Sometimes the problem isn’t your code, it’s your infrastructure.

## The Headache

Our API response time was a headache. After a full day of code reviews and query tuning, we were still stuck. We had spent hours optimizing algorithms and refining database queries, but the needle barely moved.

## The Realization

Then we took a step back and looked at the layer underneath.

**1000x improvement. Same code, different infrastructure.**

The result? We went from **20ms** latency down to **8ms**. In the world of high-frequency API calls, that reduction is massive.

## The Lesson

The lesson? **Before spending hours on code optimisations, check your network latency and infra setup.**

Even the fastest code can’t beat a slow infrastructure layer. It’s easy to get tunnel vision on Big O notation and clean code, but if your packets are taking the scenic route or your instances are under-provisioned, your code optimizations are just rearranging deck chairs.
